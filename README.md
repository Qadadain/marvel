## ‚ùì How to start the Project

### ‚öôÔ∏è Install

1. First of all you need to clone the repostory into a local folder

2. Then you have to install the dependencies by typing in your terminal :

```sh
$ npm i
```

3. You will need to create an api key [here](https://developer.marvel.com/docs) to get access to the API from [MARVEL](https://developer.marvel.com/)

4. Once you have the key, create `.env` file in the root of the project.

5. Open the `.env` file and add your key after : `REACT_APP_MARVEL_API_KEY`.  
   You should have something like : `REACT_APP_MARVEL_API_KEY=zda5451515az14e5569`.
